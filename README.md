# The A01-Kacky Hub

A website displaying the current statistics of the Trackmania "A01-Kacky" event created by The A01 team.

## Features

### The maps 

Every map in the event is shown on the home screen. Clicking on a map opens a list of everyone* who has beaten that map, ordered by their time. Hovering over a name displays their time on that map. You are also able to select how doable the map seems to you, for the sake of convenience.

<sup>(*The website fetches from Dedimania, and can therefore only collect the 30 fastest times.)</sup>

### The leaderboard

Opening the leaderboard displays the amount of finishes (shortened to "Fins") that everyone has, and their average rank. Hovering over the amount of finishes displays the number of every map they've finished.

### Dark mode toggle

Pressing the moon / sun in the bottomleft corner of the screen toggles dark mode.
